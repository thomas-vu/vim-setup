# My .vimrc file
### Different .vimrc files
- `.simplevimrc` contains just keybindings and simple UI/formatting settings
- `.vimrc` contains everything in `.simplevimrc` along with plugins and themes

### To use:
1. Clone the repo into your folder of choice
2. Run `./setup.sh [--simple]` (use the `--simple` argument to install `.simplevimrc` instead)
